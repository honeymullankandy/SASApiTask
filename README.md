Here's a sample README.md file that you can use for your project. This will provide clear instructions for setting up the project, installing dependencies, and running tests using RestAssured and TestNG in a Maven-based project.
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

   Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Java (JDK 8 or later) – For RestAssured and TestNG to run, make sure Java is installed.
Maven – For managing the project dependencies and running tests.
IDE (Optional) – IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other Java IDE for better project management and editing.
Install Dependencies:

All necessary dependencies (including RestAssured, TestNG, and others) are managed via Maven. Simply run the following command to install all dependencies:

# RestAssured API Testing with TestNG and Maven

This project demonstrates how to set up and perform **REST API testing** using **RestAssured** and **TestNG** in a **Maven** project. It provides a simple example of how to create automated tests for REST APIs with the help of **RestAssured** for API interaction and **TestNG** for running and organizing the tests.


## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Navigate to the Project Directory: Move into the project directory:

Copy code
cd your-repository
Maven Project: This is a Maven project, so you'll need to have Maven installed. You can download and install Maven from here if it's not already installed.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

Java (JDK 8 or later) – For RestAssured and TestNG to run, make sure Java is installed.
Maven – For managing the project dependencies and running tests.
IDE (Optional) – IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other Java IDE for better project management and editing.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code

cd your-repository
Install Dependencies:

All necessary dependencies (including RestAssured, TestNG, and others) are managed via Maven. Simply run the following command to install all dependencies:

bash
Copy code
mvn install
IDE Setup (Optional): If you’re using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse, you can import the project as a Maven project and it will automatically recognize all the dependencies.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are used in this project:

RestAssured: A Java-based library for testing REST APIs.
TestNG: A testing framework to organize and run tests.
Maven Surefire Plugin: For running tests using the TestNG framework.
These dependencies are defined in the pom.xml file and will be downloaded automatically when you run mvn install.

using below command mvn clean test

eg Testcase can be seen in test case folder src/test/java/Testcase.java   alternatively run as tenstNg test 

validate the report in test-output/index.html
